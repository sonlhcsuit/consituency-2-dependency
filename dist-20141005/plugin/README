To compile the example plugin in the src directory, change directory to 'ant' (cd ant) 
and type 'ant jar'. You must have ant installed in order to do this, see http://ant.apache.org/. 
The build.xml file will compile the Java file ArcDirectionAndDeprel.java in  'src' and place a 
jar-file containing the class file in the directory 'lib/plugin'. MaltEval.jar will then scan 
this directory looking for jar files. All class files in the jar file will then be dynamically 
loaded (assuming that all of them implements the interface se.vxu.msi.malteval.grouping.Grouping).
It is now possible to use these grouping strategies in the same way as the ones that comes with 
MaltEval by default.

An easy way to get started with creating your own grouping strategies is to make a copy of the Java 
code example 'src/ArcDirectoryAndDeprel.java' and place the copy in 'src'. Have a look at the 
javadoc (especially the javadoc for MaltSentence and MaltWord) in order to help you extract the 
information you need for your grouping strategy. When you are done, simply run 'ant jar' again, 
and you are ready to use your newly created grouping strategy.
